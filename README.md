# Json_sessionStorage
Example of sessionStorage object implements the same Storage interface as localStorage. However, instead of being shared with all pages from the same origin, sessionStorage data is stored separately for every window/tab. Stored data persists between pages in that window/tab for as long as it's open, but is visible nowhere else.
